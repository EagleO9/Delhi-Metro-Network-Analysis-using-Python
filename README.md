# Delhi-Metro-Network-Analysis-using-Python

# Analyzing the metro network in a city like Delhi helps improve urban transportation infrastructure, leading to better city planning and enhanced commuter experiences. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Metro Network Analysis of Delhi:

# 1 Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.

# 2 Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.

# 3 Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.

# 4 Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.

# 5 Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.
